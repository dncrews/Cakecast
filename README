This is the initial version of the Cakecast application. I built this a couple years back, when CakePHP 1.2
was the best version available. I have existing plans to port this application to CakePHP 2, Django,
and to Symfony.

This application is currently built to run on CakePHP 1.2; the version I used while building was 1.2.3.8166.


Setup instructions
--------------------
1) Unpackage / clone these files to a location outside of the webroot. This will help to keep files secure
2) Clone CakePHP Version 1.2 from the GitHub repos. "git clone -b 1.2 https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp.git"
	In future versions, this will be updated to CakePHP 2.
3) Update webroot/index.php line 44 to the absolute path to this directory
4) Update webroot/index.php line 58 to the absolute path of the CakePHP directory made in step 1.
5) Create a symlink for the /webroot to a place within your actual webroot:
	"ln -s app/webroot/ <path_to_webroot>/podcast" # puts it inside domain.com/podcast
	"rm <path_to_webroot>; ln -s app/webroot/ <path_to_webroot>" # replaces webroot (note trailing slashes)

6) Create a new database. Import the file config/sql/schema.sql
7) Copy the file config/database.php.default to config/database.php and put in your new database connection info
8) Generate a unique sha1 security hash "find ~/ | sha1sum"

# This step is only done in a separate file during development. It is to avoid people committing their stuff
	and overwriting the "clean" files.
9) Create a file config/core.local.php, adding in the following lines, with your hash where specified:
	<?php
		Configure::write('Security.salt', 'PutYourHashHere');
	?>

# These next steps are done after the security hash to ensure that your hash is included in your users passwords
10) Open controllers/users.php
	Uncomment lines 8-10 and save.
11) go to <domain>/admin/users/add
	Fill out this form and submit to add your admin user. Be sure to check the "Admin" checkbox
12) Open controllers/users.php
	Comment lines 8-10 to prevent access to this page without authorization and save.
13) Refreshing your browser page will request you now log in. Put in the information you created. 
14) Setup is now complete. Enjoy.
